The CEO of the group of companies where I work has requested an analysis of all employees on the construction sites since January 2022. This group of companies includes a real estate developer and construction company, as well as separate administrative offices and construction sites that are treated as individual companies. The group operates in different cities in 3 states of Brazil.

In a meeting, some questions were defined to be answered:

Has the average salary decreased or increased since January 2022?
How effective is our HR program to reduce the gender gap?
How are our salaries distributed across the states?
How standardized is our pay policy across the states?
How experienced is our engineering team?
In what function groups do we spend the most?
What construction sites spent the most in salaries for the period?
He also asked for some recommendations if something needed to be pursued by the company appears.
